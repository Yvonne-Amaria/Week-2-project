# Week-2-project
* SEO Tech developer Paired Programming

This project is using the `Weather API` from `rapidapi.com` 

This project employs the `forecast` portion that employs a large range of functionalities, of which we would be deriving attributes from.
The attributes we derive include the `temperature` in *Fahrenheit and Celsius*, `humidity`, `wind`, `weather condition` and `country.`

This project is specified to help a retail store with part-time employees tell how many employees will need to work based on the weather.
This is because when the weather is good, there are more customers and when there is bad weather, there are less customer.
This helps the employer plan their `schedule` ahead and know when more workers are needed.

The scope of this project maximizes the employer's profit and can be used in other areas outside this present scenario.

To use this project, the API will first require you to input your `city`, and the `date` you want to plan for.
The output would determine your scheduling.
